						<th width="140">Recreation and Parks and Environmental Improvement Loan</th>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">The Department of Recreation and Parks manages the City’s extensive network of parks, playgrounds, playing fields, swimming pools, and recreation centers. Baltimore City is proud to feature approximately 6,000 acres of parkland and public space. Within our city borders, there are over 300,000 street trees and a large inventory of park trees. In fact, Baltimore was recently ranked as 15th in the nation by ParkScore for having the most city parks and greenery.
     					</td>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">This loan will authorize the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to borrow up to $8,000,000 for projects such as neighborhood swimming pool renovation, recreation facility expansion and modernization, park rehabilitation, street trees, and improvements to Baltimore’s playgrounds. The Department of Recreation and Parks aims to create 21st century recreation facilities while maintaining approximately 6,000 acres of park land and open space and 300,000+ street trees.
     					</td>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">The presence of parks and green spaces has been proven to increase the health and happiness of a community. Both parks and recreation facilities will provide places for community members to exercise and build relationships with others in the community.

						<th width="140">Maryland Zoo in Baltimore Loan</th>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">The Maryland Zoo has always been supported by government funds. A recent loan helped the zoo to renovate and improve facilities.</td>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">This is a $200,000 capital improvement loan for the Maryland Zoo to improve, repair, and replace facilities. The Maryland Zoo Loan will support projects such as renovations to the Zoo’s aging buildings and the creation of a new penguin exhibit with underwater viewing, “green” design elements, and improved penguin husbandry conditions and water conservation.</td>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">Sustaining the Maryland Zoo's programs will continue to provide children and adults with an educational experience while also helping to conserve endangered species.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th width="140">Stormwater Utility</th>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">Just this year a stormwater pollution fee was implemented and will be based on the amount of paved surface area on each property in order to reduce stormwater pollution and restore Maryland waterways. The city already has a water utility and a sanitary wastewater utility; this charter amendment would add a third utility for stormwater. The creation of this utility is a critical step in reducing pollution here because it will protect the funds from the fee from being “borrowed” for other uses and will help ensure that the funds are used most effectively.</td>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">This charter amendment will establish a financially self-sustaining stormwater utility; authorize supplemental legislation to implement the provisions governing water, sanitary wastewater, and stormwater utilities; correct, clarify, and conform related language; and provide for a special effective date.</td>
						<td width="250" class="agenda">Baltimore City lies right on the Chesapeake Bay, and has been working on cleaning up its stormwater, so that runs off into the bay will not be harmful to the bay ecology. The city in cooperation with the organization, Blue Water Baltimore, will plant more trees, install rain gardens, remove unneeded pavement and will be able to do all this more effectively with funds that cannot be taken for other uses.</td>
